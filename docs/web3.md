## Web3 
- similar to Ethers, as it is a library used to make creating requests to the Ethereum blockchain easier. 

## ABI (Application Binary Interface) 
- the interface to interact with our smart contract

## Pinata
- a convenient IPFS API and toolkit, to store our NFT asset and metadata to ensure our NFT is truly decentralized

## Remix
- Remix IDE is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.
- Remix IDE is part of the Remix Project which is a platform for development tools that use a plugin architecture. It encompasses sub-projects including Remix Plugin Engine, Remix Libs, and of course Remix-IDE.
- Remix IDE is a powerful open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser.
- It is written in JavaScript and supports both usage in the browser, in the browser but run locally and in a desktop version.

## OpenZeppelin
- OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.
- OpenZeppelin provides a complete suite of security products to build, manage, and inspect all aspects of software development and operations for Ethereum projects.

## Ethers.js
- Ethers.js is a library that makes it easier to interact and make requests to Ethereum by wrapping standard JSON-RPC methods with more user friendly methods.
- Hardhat makes it super easy to integrate Plugins for additional tooling and extended functionality. Weâ€™ll be taking advantage of the Ethers plugin for contract deployment (Ethers.js has some super clean contract deployment methods).
