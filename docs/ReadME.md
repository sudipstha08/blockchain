## Smart contracts
- A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.


## OpenZeppelin
- OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.
- OpenZeppelin provides a complete suite of security products to build, manage, and inspect all aspects of software development and operations for Ethereum projects.

## Ethers.js
- Ethers.js is a library that makes it easier to interact and make requests to Ethereum by wrapping standard JSON-RPC methods with more user friendly methods.
- Hardhat makes it super easy to integrate Plugins for additional tooling and extended functionality. Weâ€™ll be taking advantage of the Ethers plugin for contract deployment (Ethers.js has some super clean contract deployment methods).

##Web3 is similar to Ethers, as it is a library used to make creating requests to the Ethereum blockchain easier. 

ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the interface to interact with our smart contract

Pinata, a convenient IPFS API and toolkit, to store our NFT asset and metadata to ensure our NFT is truly decentralized
