## Smart contracts
- A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

## IPFS (Interplanetary file system)
IPFS is a protocol and a peer to peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. 
IPFS uses content addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. 
IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. 


## BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain is the growing list of records called blocks which are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains the cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and the transaction data. 



## OpenZeppelin
- OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.
- OpenZeppelin provides a complete suite of security products to build, manage, and inspect all aspects of software development and operations for Ethereum projects.

## Ethers.js
- Ethers.js is a library that makes it easier to interact and make requests to Ethereum by wrapping standard JSON-RPC methods with more user friendly methods.
- Hardhat makes it super easy to integrate Plugins for additional tooling and extended functionality. Weâ€™ll be taking advantage of the Ethers plugin for contract deployment (Ethers.js has some super clean contract deployment methods).

##Web3 is similar to Ethers, as it is a library used to make creating requests to the Ethereum blockchain easier. 

ABI (Application Binary Interface) is the interface to interact with our smart contract

Pinata, a convenient IPFS API and toolkit, to store our NFT asset and metadata to ensure our NFT is truly decentralized

## commands
1. npx hardhat compile
2. npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten
