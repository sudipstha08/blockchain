## IPFS (Interplanetary file system)
- IPFS is a protocol and a peer to peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. 
- IPFS uses content addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. 
- IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing.
