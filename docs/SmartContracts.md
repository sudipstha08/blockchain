## Smart contracts
- a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. 
- It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
- They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.
- Smart contracts work by following simple “if/when…then…” statements that are written into code on a blockchain. A network of computers executes the actions  when predetermined conditions have been met and verified. These actions could include releasing funds to the appropriate parties, registering a vehicle, sending notifications, or issuing a ticket. The blockchain is then updated when the transaction is completed. That means the transaction cannot be changed, and only parties who have been granted permission can see the results.

- Within a smart contract, there can be as many stipulations as needed to satisfy the participants that the task will be completed satisfactorily. To establish the terms, participants must determine how transactions and their data are represented on the blockchain, agree on the “if/when...then…” rules that govern those transactions, explore all possible exceptions, and define a framework for resolving disputes.

- Then the smart contract can be programmed by a developer – although increasingly, organizations that use blockchain for business provide templates, web interfaces, and other online tools to simplify structuring smart contracts.

- Blockchain technology has undoubtedly revolutionized many industries. However, the hacks and exploits of many renowned blockchain applications have created notable setbacks for the long-term growth of blockchain. Blockchain networks can be secure, while applications running on them might not be as secure as expected. Blockchain applications use smart contracts for interacting with the blockchain, and smart contracts have profound security vulnerabilities. This is where you need a smart contract audit.

- The audit process for a smart contract focuses on scrutiny of the code used for underwriting the terms and conditions in the smart contract. With the help of such an audit, smart contract developers could easily identify the vulnerabilities and bugs before the deployment of smart contracts. 

- Generally, third-party entities carry out smart contract audits to ensure a thorough review of the code. On the other hand, enterprises can choose professional, smart contract auditors for carrying out the audit process. 

Smart Contract Auditing
Blockchain technology has undoubtedly revolutionized many industries. However, the hacks and exploits of many renowned blockchain applications have created notable setbacks for the long-term growth of blockchain. Blockchain networks can be secure, while applications running on them might not be as secure as expected. Blockchain applications use smart contracts for interacting with the blockchain, and smart contracts have profound security vulnerabilities. This is where you need a smart contract audit.

The audit process for a smart contract focuses on scrutiny of the code used for underwriting the terms and conditions in the smart contract. With the help of such an audit, smart contract developers could easily identify the vulnerabilities and bugs before the deployment of smart contracts. 

Generally, third-party entities carry out smart contract audits to ensure a thorough review of the code. On the other hand, enterprises can choose professional, smart contract auditors for carrying out the audit process. 

It is quite important to test the code thoroughly before deploying the smart contract. Why? Once you write the smart contract to the blockchain, it is impossible to change the code. Deploying smart contracts without proper audits could result in untoward circumstances such as discrepancies in the desired performance of the contract. At the same time, inadequate audit processes could also land you up with risks such as loss of personal data or data theft.
