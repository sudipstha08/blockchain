## Solidity

- Object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. 
- Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
- Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
- When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. Apart from exceptional cases, only the latest version receives security fixes.
- A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain
- Pragma is generally the first line of code within any Solidity file. pragma is a directive that specifies the compiler version to be used for current Solidity file.
